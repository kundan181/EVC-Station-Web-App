EV Charging Station | WebApp

The future of the automotive industry lies with the electric automobiles. There is a rising demand for Electric Cars and Application to find EV Charging Station due to their favorable effects on the enivironment and governments, increasing the awareness of this issue globally. Electirc vehicles are less expensive over the long term than conventional automobiles and have less of an impact on the environment. In electric vehicle-driven areas, an EV charging station finder app will prove to be a very useful tool that may save a lot of time and be raesonably priced. In this web app we will build a separate dashboards for user, chrarging station owner and admin of this portal. In this project we used the technology like JSP,JDBC,Servlet,Html,css and javascript. MySQL database with XAMPP server.


1. JSP is a technology that allows you to write dynamic web pages using a combination of HTML, CSS, and Java code. You can use JSP to create the user interface for your web application.
2. Servlets are Java programs that run on the server and handle requests from clients (in this case, web browsers). You can use servlets to handle the back-end processing for your web application, such as querying the database or performing calculations. 
3. To connect to a MySQL database from your Java web application, you will need to use the JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) API. This API provides a set of Java classes and interfaces that you can use to connect to a database, execute queries, and retrieve results.
4. To use JSP and servlets in your web application, you will need to install a web server such as Apache Tomcat that is capable of running Java web applications. You will also need to configure the web server to connect to your MySQL database.
5. Once you have set up your development environment, you can begin developing your web application. You can create JSP files for the user interface and servlets for the back-end processing. To access the database, you will need to use JDBC to create a connection and execute SQL queries.
